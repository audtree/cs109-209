Hi! I'm Audrey, an impact-oriented data scientist and Harvard sophomore studying Applied Math on the Economics and Computer Science Track. 

I love to work on projects that democratize knowledge, experience, and opportunity. In the last 3 years, I've revitalized a public school district's hiring practices as an analyst [@Harvard College Economics Labs](https://www.harvardeconomics.org/), contributed to 2 manuscripts in biological science [@Stanford](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4136719) and in materials science [@Harvard](https://bertoldi.seas.harvard.edu/), designed useful and elegant digital experiences as a UI/UX consultant [@Harvard Design Collective](https://www.harvarddesignco.com/), and spearheaded nationally-recognized environmental initiatives as co-president of [@Green Team](https://www.losaltosonline.com/schools/los-altos-high-earns-national-green-ribbon-for-sustainability/article_02a15773-37f6-5683-a195-b68b7572c40b.html). I'm also a big nerd for ____, and conversations around design of products, places, and markets.
