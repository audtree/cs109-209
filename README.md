# Data Analyst Portfolio - Audrey Chang

<img align="right" src="imgs/pp_circle.png" width="220">

Hi! I'm Audrey, an impact-oriented data scientist and Harvard sophomore studying Applied Math on the Economics and Computer Science Track. This repository collects data science and data analysis projects I have completed for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. 

**A bit about me...**

I love to work on projects that democratize knowledge, experience, and opportunity. 

In the last 3 years, I've...
* revitalized a public school district's hiring practices as an analyst [@Harvard College Economics Labs](https://www.harvardeconomics.org/), 
* contributed to 2 manuscripts in biological science [@Stanford](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4136719) and in materials science [@Harvard](https://bertoldi.seas.harvard.edu/), 
* designed useful and elegant digital experiences as a UI/UX consultant [@Harvard Design Collective](https://www.harvarddesignco.com/), 
* and spearheaded nationally-recognized environmental initiatives as co-president of [@Green Team](https://www.losaltosonline.com/schools/los-altos-high-earns-national-green-ribbon-for-sustainability/article_02a15773-37f6-5683-a195-b68b7572c40b.html). 

Talk to me about: applying data science, statistical & machine learning tools to business strategy, management, and marketing trends; the formation of community & social dynamics; and the design of products, places, and markets!

## Projects
<sup> Note: Some projects are associated to coding exercises and assignments from Harvard's Data Science course, CS109. It violates Copyright Laws to have the assignments available publicly, although I am happy to walk through a detailed project process upon request â€” see my contact information below! When available, a summary of my produced figures is linked in the associated repository's README. </sup>

### Analyzing Top IMDB Stars

Scraped the HTML from a webpage of [Top 100 Stars for 2021](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls577894422/) using the BeautifulSoup Python package and stored actor/actress profiles in a JSON file. Loaded data into dataframe to calculate new actor/actress metrics (age at first credit, number of credits), summary statistics (number of child stars, number of late bloomers), and explored how profiles differed between age groups and genders.  

**Skills:** web scraping, data parsing, EDA <br />
**Tools:** BeautifulSoup

### Analyzing Social and Economic Supplement Dataset 

Analyzed simulated income data from the publically available 2021 US Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement ([source](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-asec.2021.html)), provided by the US Census Bureau. (Simulated data turns discrete response variable to continuous response variable via sampling.) Visualized distribution of income by gender, occupation type, education across gender, industry, age, marital status, and of time worked and wage. Calculated Gini coefficient to [measure inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) and compared coefficient to other countries. 

**Skills:** data visualization, EDA <br />
**Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

### [Predicting change in bacteria populations](https://github.com/audtree/data-analyst-portfolio/blob/main/bacterial-change/README.md)

Built regression models to predict the percentage change in bacteria population after 4 hours based on their "spreading factor." Used k-fold cross validation and boostraps to identify the best degree polynomial regression and LASSO regularization with hypermarameter tuning to improve model consistency and identify the "most significant" set of polynomial degrees by using bootstraps.

**Skills:** LASSO regularization, polynomial regression, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, data visualization <br />
**Tools:** scikit-learn

### Predicting the selling price of cars with missing data

Analyzed [Kaggle data](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho), pre-processed and modified so that it contains missing values, to predict the selling price of used cars with a linear regression model and kNN regression model. Imputed missing data with a simple mean and verified that our prediction strategy was not affected by imputation by re-fitting models with missing indicator variables. The dataset is pre-processed and modified so that it contains missing values. The goal is to handle missing data and predict selling prices from the other features available in this dataset.

**Skills:** linear regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) regression, hyperparameter tuning <br />
**Tools:** scikit-learn
